	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p class="meta">Hello! üëã I'm David.</p>
	<p>Welcome to my corner of the Internet. This is where I balance my content consumption with creation.</p>
	<p>The conventional wisdom these days is to create an online presence with a narrow or specialised focus to appeal to people with specific interests. This is not that: not every post here will be interesting to everyone.</p>
	<p>There's no subscribe button, but if you enjoy the blog, there's an RSS (Atom) feed. If there's only a single post in the entire reel that's of any interest at all, that's great! I hope you found it valuable.</p>
	<p>If you'd like to discuss a post, feel free to link it wherever you like.</p>
	<h2>What do you do?</h2>
	<p>This is a personal blog, not a professional blog, but some brief context:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>I have a double degree in Chemical Engineering and Mathematical &amp; Computer Sciences, majoring in Computer Science.</li>
		<li>Under the business name 44Apps, I built educational iPad and iPhone (ca. iOS 7) apps for high school Physics and Chemistry students.</li>
		<li>I've worked at two well-known Australian software companies.</li>
		<li>I still work at one of them. I'm currently a full-stack web developer.</li>
