	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p class="meta">Hello! üëã I'm David.</p>
	<p>Welcome to my corner of the Internet. This is where I balance my content consumption with creation.</p>
	<p>The conventional wisdom these days is to create an online presence with a very narrow or specialised focus to appeal to people with specific interests. I want to deliberately do the opposite. This blog will be a wide-ranging collection of content, with the only common thread that everything comes from me.</p>
	<p>Consequently, not every post here will be interesting to everyone. And that's fine.</p>
	<p>There's no subscribe button, but if you enjoy what I do, there's an RSS (Atom) feed. If there's only a single post in the entire reel that's of any interest at all, that's great! I hope you found it valuable.</p>
	<p>If you want to discuss a post, feel free to link it wherever you want to discuss it. My email address is below if you'd like my input.</p>
	<h2>What do you do?</h2>
	<p>One goal of this blog is to be completely separate from my professional life. That said, what I do will of course influence what I write, and in some cases that context will be useful. So, briefly:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>I have a degree in Mathematical and Computer Sciences, majoring in Computer Science.</li>
		<li>I have a degree in Chemical Engineering, with first class honours.</li>
		<li>Under the business name 44Apps, I built educational iPad and iPhone apps (iOS7-era) for high school Chemistry and Physics students.</li>
		<li>I've worked at two well-known Australian software companies.</li>
		<li>I still work at one of them. I'm currently a full-stack web developer.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If you'd like a proper CV, my email address is at the bottom of the page.</p>
	<h2>What <em>else</em> do you do?</h2>
	<p>I hope this blog effectively answers that question.</p>
	<h2>Feedback</h2>
	<p>If you want to get in touch about any of my posts feel free to send me an email.</p>
	<p>If you've <em>really</em> appreciated something I've posted, there's a link in the footer where you can send me a tip with a thank you note. Tips are very much appreciated but certainly not mandatory!</p>
	<p>If you want to get in touch about commissioning something related to one of my posts, please send me an email and we can discuss it.</p>
