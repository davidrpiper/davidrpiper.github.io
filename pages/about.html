	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p class="meta">Hello! 👋 I'm David.</p>
	<p>Welcome to my corner of the Internet. This is where I attempt to balance my content consumption with creation.</p>
	<p>The standard play these days is to create an online presence with a narrow and specialised focus to appeal to people with specific interests.</p>
	<p>This is not that.</p>
	<p>There's no Subscribe button or bell to hit, but if you enjoy the blog, there's an RSS feed. Feel free to stay as long as you like. You're not being tracked and the page weight is as light as I could make it. Hopefully there's something here you enjoy!</p>
	<h2>Wait, what do you do?</h2>
	<p>This is a personal blog, but <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidpiper44/">here's my LinkedIn</a> if you're interested.</p>
	<h2>Feedback and Contact</h2>
	<p>If you'd like to get in touch, say Hello at <a href="mailto:dpiper.public@gmail.com">dpiper.public@gmail.com</a>.</p>
