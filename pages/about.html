	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p class="meta">Hello! üëã I'm David.</p>
	<p>Welcome to my corner of the Internet. This is where I balance my content consumption with creation.</p>
	<p>The conventional wisdom these days is to create an online presence with a very narrow or specialised focus to appeal to people with specific interests. I plan to do the opposite &mdash; this blog is intentionally a wide-ranging collection of content.</p>
	<p>Consequently, not every post here will be interesting to everyone.</p>
	<p>There's no subscribe button, but if you enjoy the blog, there's an RSS (Atom) feed. If there's only a single post in the entire reel that's of any interest at all, that's great! I hope you found it valuable.</p>
	<p>If you'd like to discuss a post, feel free to link it wherever you want.</p>
	<h2>What do you do?</h2>
	<p>This blog is designed to be completely separate from my professional life. That said, what I do will influence what I write, and in some cases that context will be useful. So, briefly:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>I have a degree in Mathematical and Computer Sciences, majoring in Computer Science.</li>
		<li>I have a degree in Chemical Engineering, with first class honours.</li>
		<li>Under the business name 44Apps, I built educational iPad and iPhone (~iOS7) apps for high school Physics and Chemistry students.</li>
		<li>I've worked at two well-known Australian software companies.</li>
		<li>I still work at one of them. I'm currently a full-stack web developer.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If you'd like a copy of my CV, my email address is below.</p>
	<h2>What <em>else</em> do you do?</h2>
	<p>Hopefully this blog effectively answers that question! üôÇ</p>
	<h2>Feedback and Contact</h2>
