<h1>So open-minded that our brains fall out</h1>
<p class="meta">17 Nov, 2020 ⏳ 30 second read</p>
<p>I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and finally tracked down the original source:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let us keep our minds open, by all means, as long as that means keeping our sense of perspective and seeking an understanding of the forces which mould the world. <em>But don’t keep your minds so open that your brains fall out!</em> There are still things in this world which are true and things which are false; acts which are right and acts which are wrong, even if there are statesmen who hide their designs under the cloak of high-sounding phrases.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>— Walter Kotschnig, November 8, 1939</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Coincidentally, I'm part way through <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34890015-factfulness"><em>Factfulness</em>, by Hans Rosling</a>.</p>
