        <h1>Origin</h1><p>Welcome to my blog! This site is built with my own custom site generator, so I thought I'd use this first post to describe how it works.</p><p>There are three GitHub repos for this blog. It could potentially be condensed into a single repo but it felt cleaner to split it up into its logical parts.</p><ol><li>The Github Pages repository</li><li>The Blog Reel</li><li>The Site Generator</li></ol><h3>The Github Pages repository</h3><p>This is what you're seeing - it's the repo that contains the website tree. Github Pages now supports HTTPS with custom domains too! 🎉</p><h3>The Blog Reel</h3><p>This is a flat repo of markdown files with the individual posts. They're named in a way that forces both alphabetical and chronological order - for example, this file is named <code>00001-origin.md</code>. There's also a folder called <code>assets</code>, which willhold what it says one day soon.</p><p>The markdown files actaully start with a bit of HTTP-esque metadata for things like url, title, tags, publish date, etc. Most of this is really only needed to keep the Atom feed happy.</p><p>Then there's an empty line, and then the markdown starts.</p><h3>The Site Generator</h3><p>The site generator repo contains scripts to build the site from the blog reel. It pulls the blog reel down, feeds it through about 300 lines of Python and generates the full HTML tree for the blog.</p><p>The markdown to HTML conversion happens in a single line. The rest of the Python code is a combination of extracting data from the raw posts and using a poor-man's HTML templating system ~definitely not just find-and-replacing pre-defined symbols~ to generate the home page, the Atom feed, and all the blog post pages, with sequential links.</p><p>The full HTML tree is then copied into the Github Pages repo, committed and pushed.</p><p>And that's it!</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <h1>Reading the writing on the wall</h1><p>I've been playing a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">Go</a> recently, and catching up on the progress of Go AIs since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol">AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol 4-1</a> in March 2016. That "1" was probably the last game a human will ever win against top Go AIs.</p><p>In the last few years, humans have been learning from robots. New shapes and strategies have been discovered and some very old strategies have made a comeback. Some Go AIs are able to provide move-by-move "win percentages" which are enormously helpful for evaluating moves in game reviews. There are caveats though - there is a duality to learning and teaching, and AIs are taught how to play Go, not how to teach it.</p><p>Normally (in the sense of "norms" vs. "rules") it is polite to resign a game when it has become clear you cannot win.</p><p>But the thing is: how do you <em>know</em>?</p><p>A stronger player will generally know before a weaker player, and a robot will likely "know" well before most humans. Even players of the same strength may have different opinions depending on their skill in different aspects of the game. Which means in many games there is a time when one player knows the game is over, but the other player hasn't realised yet and continues playing.</p><p>This reminded me of a quote from Iain M. Banks' <em>The Player of Games</em>. At this point in the story, Gurgeh - the main character - is many days into an immensely large and difficult game of strategy with the (other) greatest game player in the galaxy, Emperor Nicosar. After weeks of play:</p><blockquote>  <p><em>It goes on until it ends</em>, Gurgeh thought to himself one day, and at the same time as the banality of the thought struck him, he saw that it was over. The climax had been reached. It was done, destroyed, could be no more. It was not finished, but it was over. A terrible sadness swamped him, took hold of him like a piece and made him sway and nearly fall, so that he had to walk to his seat and pull himself on to it like an old man.</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <p>'Oh...' he heard himself say.</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <p>He looked at Nicosar, but the emperor hadn't seen it yet.</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <p>...</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <p>Gurgeh couldn't believe it. The game was over; couldn't <em>anybody</em> see that? He looked despairingly around the faces of the officials, the spectators, the observers and Adjudicators. What was wrong with them all? He looked back at the board, hoping desperately that he might have missed something, made some mistake that meant there was still something Nicosar could do, that the perfect dance might last a little longer. He could see nothing. It was done.</p></blockquote><p>The writing is on the wall whether you can read it or not.</p>

        <h1>So open-minded that our brains fall out</h1><p>I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and finally tracked down the original source:</p><blockquote>  <p>Let us keep our minds open, by all means, as long as that means keeping our sense of perspective and seeking an understanding of the forces which mould the world. <em>But don’t keep your minds so open that your brains fall out!</em> There are still things in this world which are true and things which are false; acts which are right and acts which are wrong, even if there are statesmen who hide their designs under the cloak of high-sounding phrases.</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <p>— Walter Kotschnig, November 8, 1939</p></blockquote><p>Coincidentally, I'm part way through <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34890015-factfulness"><em>Factfulness</em>, by Hans Rosling</a>.</p>

        <h1>In His Image</h1><p>I finished <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Talos_Principle">The Talos Principle</a> the other day. I offer no spoilers. The whole game was an incredible experience and I highly recommend it if you enjoy puzzle games and philosophy.</p><p>Since the opening few levels, I've been dancing with the difficult questions it asks about humanity. Many of these questions weave beautifully with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuval_Noah_Harari">Yuval Noah Harari</a>'s philosophy of stories: how stories are a defining characteristic of our species, and how the stories we tell shape our view of reality.</p><p>I don't know the Bible very well, but I know some of the more popular lines and verses. One of them (which I've since learned comes from Genesis 1:27) is:</p><blockquote>  <p>God created man in His own image.</p></blockquote><p>Combined with my thougths about The Talos Principle, I suddenly realised that this line contains an enormous, almost meta, irony.</p><p>For what is the Bible, but man creating God in <em>his</em> own image?</p>

    <title>Could the sun be invisible?</title>

    <updated>2021-11-06T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <h1>Could the sun be invisible?</h1><p>I went down a rabbit hole recently, pondering the question:</p><blockquote>  <p>Assuming a species has evolved eyes, could they evolve in such a way that the sun is invisible?</p></blockquote><p>There are a few more assumptions needed here, like the sun being the primary source of heat/energy for the celestial body that the species is evolving on, etc. Let's just say it's a species evolving on Earth.</p><p>Below is a graph<a href="https://www.fondriest.com/environmental-measurements/parameters/weather/solar-radiation/">[1]</a> of our sun's radiation spectrum:</p><p><img src="/blog-assets/solar-radiation.jpg" title="Graph of the solar radiation spectrum, with a peak around the 500nm wavelength"></p><p>We can see that the visible part of the spectrum aligns with the peak area of the specturm. In fact the source<a href="https://www.fondriest.com/environmental-measurements/parameters/weather/solar-radiation/">[1]</a> actually has a short snippet about this:</p><blockquote>  <p>Predators would not be able to efficiently hunt prey without light from the sun and prey would not be able to take advantage of dark areas if predators were adapted to dark habitats. Human eyes are adapted to the visible spectrum, though some other species can see ultraviolet light in addition to colors.</p></blockquote><h2>Tangent: Why isn't the sky purple?</h2><p>Contrary to popular belief, the sky is not blue because of the ozone in the stratosphere. The sky appears blue due to the scattering of all wavelengths of light by all gases in the atmosphere. This is known as diffuse sky radiation. I'll let let <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_sky_radiation">Wikipedia explain</a>:</p><blockquote>  <p>The dominant radiative scattering processes in the atmosphere are Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering; they are elastic, meaning that a photon of light can be deviated from its path without being absorbed and without changing wavelength.</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <p>Earth's atmosphere scatters short-wavelength light more efficiently than that of longer wavelengths. Because its wavelengths are shorter, blue light is more strongly scattered than the longer-wavelength lights, red or green. Hence, the result that when looking at the sky away from the direct incident sunlight, the human eye perceives the sky to be blue.</p></blockquote><p>So if short-wavelength light is scattered more efficiently, and the shortest wavelength the human eye can perceive is violet, not blue, why isn't the sky violet? (Naturally, there's an <a href="https://xkcd.com/1145">xkcd for this</a>.)</p><p>It turns out the sky isn't violet because of the way our eyes have evolved<a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/BlueSky/blue_sky.html">[2]</a>:</p><blockquote>  <p>We have three types of colour receptors, or cones, in our retina.  They are called red, blue and green because they respond most strongly to light at those wavelengths.  As they are stimulated in different proportions, our visual system constructs the colours we see.</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <p>When we look up at the sky, the red cones respond to the small amount of scattered red light, but also less strongly to orange and yellow wavelengths. The green cones respond to yellow and the more strongly scattered green and green-blue wavelengths. The blue cones are stimulated by colours near blue wavelengths, which are very strongly scattered. If there were no indigo and violet in the spectrum, the sky would appear blue with a slight green tinge. But the most strongly scattered indigo and violet wavelengths stimulate the red cones slightly as well as the blue, which is why these colours appear blue with an added red tinge. The net effect is that the red and green cones are stimulated about equally by the light from the sky, while the blue is stimulated more strongly. This combination accounts for the pale sky blue colour.</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <p>It may not be a coincidence that our vision is adjusted to see the sky as a pure hue. We have evolved to fit in with our environment; and the ability to separate natural colours most clearly is probably a survival advantage.</p></blockquote><h2>Return</h2><p>Now we return to the original question: could eyes evolve in such a way that the sun is invisible?</p><p>Among species with eyes, it seems reasonable to assume that those who see more wavelengths of light probably have a survival advantage over those who see fewer. Imagine if we could only see colours at the red end of the visible spectrum - we'd be missing out on a lot of the world. But what if we were missing out on the <em>whole</em> world of colour? What if our eyes - those rods and cones - evolved differently?</p><p>And now we have to stop, because if eyes cannot see any wavelengths emitted by the sun, can we still call them eyes?</p><p>I think the answer is no. And therefore my original question is poorly formed.</p><p>We understand "eyes" and "vision" <em>specifically</em> in relation to the visible spectrum of a sun or light source. We actually have another sense that can detect the infrared radiation from the sun (touch) - it tells our body how warm it is. We don't descibe that as 'vision', and we don't think of it as 'seeing' heat.</p><p>So I've basically <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">nerd sniped</a> myself. The sun can't be invisible for any species with sight, because our definitions of "eyes" and "sight" directly depend on that source of light.</p><p>Seems I need a more robust mental model for thinking about the senses.</p><h2>Sources</h2><p>[1] Fondriest Environmental, Inc. “Solar Radiation and Photosynethically Active Radiation.” Fundamentals of Environmental Measurements. 21 Mar. 2014.

        <h1>La Nuit de Noël</h1><p>I thought it would be fun to start composing pieces in the style of composers, artists and genres that I enjoy.</p><p>The motivation for this is both education and laziness:</p><ul><li>Education because I'll learn a lot about the music I'm imitating</li><li>Laziness because it means I don't have to expend quite as much creative energy to come up wiht something <em>wholly</em> original.</li></ul><p>It's really just another form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_writing">Constrained Writing</a>. With an idea to start simple in my imitation, I picked Erik Satie's three <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xm7s9eGxU">Gymnopédies</a>.</p><p>The result is a piece that, to me, seems to fit a quiet, snowy night in the cramped, cobblestoned streets of somewhere like Victorian England.</p><p>I think it's <em>slightly</em> too diatonic or consonant compared to Satie's Gymnopédies, but I really liked the whimsical and satisfying conclusion.
