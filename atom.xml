        <h1>Origin</h1><p>Welcome to my blog! This site is built with my own custom site generator, so I thought I'd use this first post to describe how it works.</p><p>There are three GitHub repos for this blog. It could potentially be condensed into a single repo but it felt cleaner to split it up into its logical parts.</p><ol><li>The Github Pages repository</li><li>The Blog Reel</li><li>The Site Generator</li></ol><h3>The Github Pages repository</h3><p>This is what you're seeing - it's the repo that contains the website tree. Github Pages now supports HTTPS with custom domains too! ðŸŽ‰</p><h3>The Blog Reel</h3><p>This is a flat repo of markdown files with the individual posts. They're named in a way that forces both alphabetical and chronological order - for example, this file is named <code>00001-origin.md</code>. There's also a folder called <code>assets</code>, which willhold what it says one day soon.</p><p>The markdown files actaully start with a bit of HTTP-esque metadata for things like url, title, tags, publish date, etc. Most of this is really only needed to keep the Atom feed happy.</p><p>Then there's an empty line, and then the markdown starts.</p><h3>The Site Generator</h3><p>The site generator repo contains scripts to build the site from the blog reel. It pulls the blog reel down, feeds it through about 300 lines of Python and generates the full HTML tree for the blog.</p><p>The markdown to HTML conversion happens in a single line. The rest of the Python code is a combination of extracting data from the raw posts and using a poor-man's HTML templating system ~definitely not just find-and-replacing pre-defined symbols~ to generate the home page, the Atom feed, and all the blog post pages, with sequential links.</p><p>The full HTML tree is then copied into the Github Pages repo, committed and pushed.</p><p>And that's it!</p>

        <h1>The English alphabet is a singly-linked list</h1><p>It occurred to me the other day that one of the most common uses of a singly-linked list is the English alphabet.</p><p>At least, I've never memorised it backwards. Even if I did, I suppose I'd only have two singly-linked lists without more practice anyway.</p>

    <title>Reading the writing on the wall</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <h1>Reading the writing on the wall</h1><p>I've been playing a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">Go</a> recently, and catching up on the progress of Go AIs since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol">AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol 4-1</a> in March 2016. That "1" was probably the last game a human will ever win against top Go AIs.</p><p>In the last few years, humans have been learning from robots. New shapes and strategies have been discovered and some very old strategies have made a comeback. Some Go AIs are able to provide move-by-move "win percentages" which are enormously helpful for evaluating moves in game reviews. There are caveats though - there is a duality to learning and teaching, and AIs are taught how to play Go, not how to teach it.</p><p>Normally (in the sense of "norms" vs. "rules") it is polite to resign a game when it has become clear you cannot win.</p><p>But the thing is: how do you <em>know</em>?</p><p>A stronger player will generally know before a weaker player, and a robot will likely "know" well before most humans. Even players of the same strength may have different opinions depending on their skill in different aspects of the game. Which means in many games there is a time when one player knows the game is over, but the other player hasn't realised yet and continues playing.</p><p>This reminded me of a quote from Iain M. Banks' <em>The Player of Games</em>. At this point in the story, Gurgeh - the main character - is many days into an immensely large and difficult game of strategy with the (other) greatest game player in the galaxy, Emperor Nicosar. After weeks of play:</p><blockquote>  <p><em>It goes on until it ends</em>, Gurgeh thought to himself one day, and at the same time as the banality of the thought struck him, he saw that it was over. The climax had been reached. It was done, destroyed, could be no more. It was not finished, but it was over. A terrible sadness swamped him, took hold of him like a piece and made him sway and nearly fall, so that he had to walk to his seat and pull himself on to it like an old man.</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <p>'Oh...' he heard himself say.</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <p>He looked at Nicosar, but the emperor hadn't seen it yet.</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <p>...</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <p>Gurgeh couldn't believe it. The game was over; couldn't <em>anybody</em> see that? He looked despairingly around the faces of the officials, the spectators, the observers and Adjudicators. What was wrong with them all? He looked back at the board, hoping desperately that he might have missed something, made some mistake that meant there was still something Nicosar could do, that the perfect dance might last a little longer. He could see nothing. It was done.</p></blockquote><p>The writing is on the wall whether you can read it or not.</p>

        <h1>So open-minded that our brains fall out</h1><p>I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and finally tracked down the original source:</p><blockquote>  <p>Let us keep our minds open, by all means, as long as that means keeping our sense of perspective and seeking an understanding of the forces which mould the world. <em>But donâ€™t keep your minds so open that your brains fall out!</em> There are still things in this world which are true and things which are false; acts which are right and acts which are wrong, even if there are statesmen who hide their designs under the cloak of high-sounding phrases.</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <p>â€” Walter Kotschnig, November 8, 1939</p></blockquote><p>Coincidentally, I'm part way through <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34890015-factfulness"><em>Factfulness</em>, by Hans Rosling</a>.</p>

        <h1>In His Image</h1><p>I finished <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Talos_Principle">The Talos Principle</a> the other day. I offer no spoilers. The whole game was an incredible experience and I highly recommend it if you enjoy puzzle games and philosophy.</p><p>Since the opening few levels, I've been dancing with the difficult questions it asks about humanity. Many of these questions weave beautifully with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuval_Noah_Harari">Yuval Noah Harari</a>'s philosophy of stories: how stories are a defining characteristic of our species, and how the stories we tell shape our view of reality.</p><p>I don't know the Bible very well, but I know some of the more popular lines and verses. One of them (which I've since learned comes from Genesis 1:27) is:</p><blockquote>  <p>God created man in His own image.</p></blockquote><p>Combined with my thougths about The Talos Principle, I suddenly realised that this line contains an enormous, almost meta, irony.</p><p>For what is the Bible, but man creating God in <em>his</em> own image?</p>
