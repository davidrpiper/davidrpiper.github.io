<h1>In His Image</h1>
<p class="meta">6 Mar, 2021</p>
<p>I finished <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Talos_Principle">The Talos Principle</a> the other day. I offer no spoilers. The whole game was an incredible experience and I highly recommend it if you enjoy puzzle games and philosophy.</p>

<p>Since the opening few levels, I've been dancing with the difficult questions it asks about humanity. Many of these questions weave beautifully with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuval_Noah_Harari">Yuval Noah Harari</a>'s philosophy of stories: how stories are a defining characteristic of our species, and how the stories we tell shape our view of reality.</p>

<p>I don't know the Bible very well, but I know some of the more popular lines and verses. One of them (which I've since learned comes from Genesis 1:27) is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>God created man in His own image.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Combined with my thougths about The Talos Principle, I suddenly realised that this line contains an enormous, almost meta, irony.</p>

<p>For what is the Bible, but man creating God in <em>his</em> own image?</p>
