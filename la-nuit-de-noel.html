<h1>La Nuit de Noël</h1>
<p class="meta">25 Dec, 2021 ⏳ 1 minute read</p>
<p>I thought it would be fun to start composing pieces in the style of composers, artists and genres that I enjoy.</p>

<p>The motivation for this is both education and laziness:</p>

<ul>
<li>Education because I'll learn a lot about the music I'm imitating</li>
<li>Laziness because it means I don't have to expend quite as much creative energy to come up wiht something <em>wholly</em> original.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's really just another form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_writing">Constrained Writing</a>. With an idea to start simple in my imitation, I picked Erik Satie's three <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xm7s9eGxU">Gymnopédies</a>.</p>

<p>The result is a piece that, to me, seems to fit a quiet, snowy night in the cramped, cobblestoned streets of somewhere like Victorian England.</p>

<p>I think it's <em>slightly</em> too diatonic or consonant compared to Satie's Gymnopédies, but I really liked the whimsical and satisfying conclusion. Particularly at this time of year.</p>

<p>So I present <a href="https://musescore.com/davidpiper/la-nuit-de-noel">La Nuit de Noël</a>, an offering of muted festivity.</p>

<p>Merry Christmas 🎄</p>
